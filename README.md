1.  Write a program to validates if a password is strong

A password is strong if it contains at least 2 special characters, 
at least 2 Uppercase letters, at least a lowercase letter, at least a number 
and the minimum length is 8characters

eg "Crossword" is NOT a strong password
 "Cospis@1" is NOT a strong password

"Cos@P!s895" is a STRONG password

2.  For added complexity Question 1,  if the length is better 8 and 12, 
print strong , if it is between 13 and 15, print very strong , if it is above 15, 
print excellent

3.  For added complexity to question 2, after validating a password, 
ask if the user will like to validate another password, if user say yes, 
program should start again automatically else program should terminate
